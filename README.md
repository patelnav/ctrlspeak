### üì¶ Installation

#### Using Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
# Basic installation (MLX models only)
brew tap patelnav/ctrlspeak
brew install ctrlspeak

# Recommended: Full installation with all model support
brew install ctrlspeak --with-nvidia --with-whisper

# Check what models are available after installation
ctrlspeak --list-models
```

**What each option does:**
- `--with-nvidia`: Enables NVIDIA Parakeet and Canary models (recommended for best performance)
- `--with-whisper`: Enables OpenAI Whisper models (optional)

**If you get "No module named 'nemo'" errors:**
```bash
# Reinstall with NVIDIA support
brew reinstall ctrlspeak --with-nvidia
```

#### Manual Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/patelnav/ctrlspeak.git
cd ctrlspeak
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it on macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
# Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For NVIDIA model support (optional)
pip install -r requirements-nvidia.txt

# For Whisper model support (optional)
pip install -r requirements-whisper.txt
```

## üß∞ Entry Points

- `ctrlspeak.py`: The full-featured star of the show  
- `live_transcribe.py`: Continuous transcription for testing vibes  
- `test_transcription.py`: Debug or benchmark with ease  


### Workflow

1. Run ctrlSPEAK in a terminal window:
   ```bash
   # If installed with Homebrew
   ctrlspeak
   
   # If installed manually (from the project directory with activated venv)
   python ctrlspeak.py
   ```
2. Triple-tap Ctrl to start recording
3. Speak clearly into your microphone
4. Triple-tap Ctrl again to stop recording
5. The transcribed text will be automatically pasted at your cursor position

## Models

ctrlSPEAK uses open-source speech recognition models:

- **Parakeet 0.6B (MLX)** (default): `mlx-community/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` model optimized for Apple Silicon. Recommended for most users on M1/M2/M3 Macs.
- **Canary**: NVIDIA NeMo's `nvidia/canary-1b-flash` multilingual model (En, De, Fr, Es) with punctuation, but can be slower. Requires `requirements-nvidia.txt`.
- **Canary (180M)**: NVIDIA NeMo's `nvidia/canary-180m-flash` multilingual model, smaller and less accurate. Requires `requirements-nvidia.txt`.
- **Whisper** (optional): OpenAI's `openai/whisper-large-v3` model. A fast, accurate, and powerful model that includes excellent punctuation and capitalization. Requires `requirements-whisper.txt`.

**Note:** The `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-1.1b` model is also available for testing, but it is not recommended for general use as it lacks punctuation and is slower than the `0.6b` model. Requires `requirements-nvidia.txt`.

The models are automatically downloaded from HuggingFace the first time you use them.

### Listing Supported Models

To see a list of all supported models, use the `--list-models` flag:

```bash
ctrlspeak --list-models
```

This will output a list of the available model aliases and their corresponding Hugging Face model names.

### Apple Silicon (MLX) Acceleration

For users on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3 Macs), an optimized version of the Parakeet model is available using Apple's MLX framework. This is the default model and provides a significant performance boost.

## Model Selection

You can select a model using the `--model` flag. You can use either the full model name from HuggingFace or a short alias.

**Short Names:**

*   `parakeet`: Parakeet 0.6B optimized for Apple Silicon (MLX). (Default)
*   `canary`: NVIDIA's Canary 1B Flash model.
*   `canary-180m`: NVIDIA's Canary 180M Flash model.
*   `whisper`: OpenAI's Whisper v3 model.

**Full Model URL:**

You can also provide a full model URL from Hugging Face. For example:

```bash
ctrlspeak --model nvidia/parakeet-tdt-1.1b
```

This will download and use the specified model.

```bash
# Using Homebrew installation
ctrlspeak --model parakeet  # Default
ctrlspeak --model canary         # Multilingual with punctuation
ctrlspeak --model canary-180m    # The smaller Canary model
ctrlspeak --model canary-v2
ctrlspeak --model whisper        # OpenAI's model
ctrlspeak --model parakeet-mlx # MLX-accelerated model

# Using manual installation
python ctrlspeak.py --model parakeet
python ctrlspeak.py --model canary
python ctrlspeak.py --model canary-180m
python ctrlspeak.py --model canary-v2
python ctrlspeak.py --model whisper
python ctrlspeak.py --model parakeet-mlx
```

For debugging, you can use the `--debug` flag:

```bash
ctrlspeak --debug
```

## Models Tested

1. **Parakeet 0.6B (NVIDIA)** - `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` (Default)
2. **Parakeet 1.1B (NVIDIA)** - `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-1.1b`
3. **Canary (NVIDIA)** - `nvidia/canary-1b-flash`
4. **Canary (NVIDIA)** - `nvidia/canary-180m-flash`
5. **Canary (NVIDIA)** - `nvidia/canary-1b-v2`
6. **Whisper (OpenAI)** - `openai/whisper-large-v3`

## Performance Comparison

| Model | Framework | Load Time (s) | Transcription Time (s) | Output Example (test.wav) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3`** | MLX (Apple Silicon) | 0.97 | 0.53 | "Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait." |
| | NeMo (NVIDIA) | 15.52 | 1.68 | |
| **`parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2`** | MLX (Apple Silicon) | 0.99 | 0.56 | "Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait." |
| | NeMo (NVIDIA) | 8.23 | 1.61 | |
| **`canary-1b-flash`** | NeMo (NVIDIA) | 32.06 | 3.20 | "Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait." |
| **`canary-180m-flash`** | NeMo (NVIDIA) | 6.16 | 3.20 | "Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait." |
| **`whisper-large-v3`** | Transformers (OpenAI) | 5.44 | 2.53 | "Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait." |

*Testing performed on a MacBook Pro (M2 Max) with a 7-second audio file (`test.wav`). Your results may vary.*

**Note:** Whisper model uses translate mode to enable proper punctuation and capitalization for English transcription.

## Permissions

The app requires:
- Microphone access (for recording audio)
- Accessibility permissions (for global keyboard shortcuts)

You'll be prompted to grant these permissions on first run.

## Troubleshooting

- **No sound on recording start/stop**: Ensure your system volume is not muted
- **Keyboard shortcuts not working**: Grant accessibility permissions in System Settings
- **Transcription errors**: Try speaking more clearly or using the other model

## Release Process

This outlines the steps to create a new release and update the associated Homebrew tap.

**1. Prepare the Release:**

*   Ensure the code is stable and tests pass.
*   Update the version number in the following files:
    *   `VERSION` (e.g., `1.2.0`)
    *   `__init__.py` (`__version__ = "1.2.0"`)
    *   `pyproject.toml` (`version = "1.2.0"`)
*   Commit these version changes:
    ```bash
    git add VERSION __init__.py pyproject.toml
    git commit -m "Bump version to X.Y.Z"
    ```

**2. Tag and Push:**

*   Create a git tag matching the version:
    ```bash
    git tag vX.Y.Z
    ```
*   Push the commits and the tag to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push && git push origin vX.Y.Z
    ```

**3. Update Homebrew Tap:**

*   The source code tarball URL is automatically generated based on the tag (usually `https://github.com/<your-username>/ctrlspeak/archive/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`).
*   Download the tarball using its URL and calculate its SHA256 checksum:
    ```bash
    # Replace URL with the actual tarball link based on the tag
    curl -sL https://github.com/<your-username>/ctrlspeak/archive/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz | shasum -a 256
    ```
*   Clone or navigate to your Homebrew tap repository (e.g., `../homebrew-ctrlspeak`).
*   Edit the formula file (e.g., `Formula/ctrlspeak.rb`):
    *   Update the `url` line with the tag tarball URL.
    *   Update the `sha256` line with the checksum you calculated.
    *   *Optional:* Update the `version` line if necessary (though it's often inferred).
    *   *Optional:* If `requirements.txt` or dependencies changed, update the `depends_on` and `install` steps accordingly.
*   Commit and push the changes in the tap repository:
    ```bash
    cd ../path/to/homebrew-ctrlspeak # Or wherever your tap repo is
    git add Formula/ctrlspeak.rb
    git commit -m "Update ctrlspeak to vX.Y.Z"
    git push
    ```

**4. Verify (Optional):**

*   Run `brew update` locally to fetch the updated formula.
*   Run `brew upgrade ctrlspeak` to install the new version.
*   Test the installed version.
