## Permissions

The app requires:
- Microphone access (for recording audio)
- Accessibility permissions (for global keyboard shortcuts)

You'll be prompted to grant these permissions on first run.

## Troubleshooting

- **No sound on recording start/stop**: Ensure your system volume is not muted
- **Keyboard shortcuts not working**: Grant accessibility permissions in System Settings
- **Transcription errors**: Try speaking more clearly or using the other model
